# AI Ops Assistant (GenAI Intern Assignment)

This project was built as part of the GenAI Intern assignment.  
The idea behind it is simple: given a task written in plain English, the system breaks it
down into steps, runs those steps using real APIs, and returns the final result in a
structured way.

The focus of this project is not just on getting results, but on designing a clean and
reliable multi-agent workflow that can be easily extended later.

## Architecture Overview

The system is designed using a **multi-agent approach**, where each agent has a clear and
limited responsibility.

### 1. Planner Agent
The Planner Agent takes the user’s task and converts it into a structured JSON plan.
Each step in the plan specifies which tool should be used and what action needs to be
performed.  
If the LLM fails or returns an unexpected response, the planner falls back to a safe
default plan so that the system does not break.

### 2. Executor Agent
The Executor Agent reads the plan generated by the planner and executes each step one by
one.  
It interacts with real third-party APIs and is designed to handle API failures gracefully,
so one failing step does not crash the entire application.

### 3. Verifier Agent
The Verifier Agent checks whether the execution produced valid results and ensures that
the system returns a complete end-to-end response to the user.

## Integrated APIs

The project currently integrates the following external APIs:

- **GitHub API**  
  Used to search and retrieve popular repositories based on stars.

- **OpenWeatherMap API**  
  Used to fetch current weather information for a given city.
